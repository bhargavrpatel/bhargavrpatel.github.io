Hello, my name is Bhargav Patel. I was born on March 17, 1993 in the country of Yoga, and Bollywood; India. I still remember the days when I used to visit one of my best friend's house to watch him play games on his PC. I never really got to touch the computer myself, but none the less, I was lost in watching my best friend play video games. I truely believe this was part of what attracted me towards computers and electronics in general. I then started visiting Cyber Cafes, paying an hourly fee to play games that were likely pirated by the owners. As I got older, my passion for video games and computers grew stronger.

In hopes of a better future for myself and my sibling, my parents moves us to Toronto, Canada in 2005. Shortly after coming to Canada, I subsituted Cyber Cafes with public libraries, playing online falsh games and learning about "web development" via creating websites on site builders such as FreeWeb and Piczo. After some time, I maanged to snag my own PC, and upgrade it and it is after this moment I started getting more into serious programming. I stumbled upon many online resources which taught me basics in programming languages such as C, Python, Ruby etc.

At this point in my life, I noticed that I was not very keen on going to school and getting high grades. I was more interested in finishing the day so that I can go back to my PC and get lost in the world of programming; pretty cheesy I know. A consequence of this was of course poor grades, which limited my post-secondary options.

I opted to attend Carleton University for Computer Systems Engineering program. There, I learned more about what actually happens inside the various chips of the computer as programs were run. I even got to design some chips and work on some cool projects, such as "indoor traffic monitoring system"; a series of fancy words that boil down to a switches in the floor that trigger a counter when a human passes by.

Though I was thoroughly enjoying my post secondary education, I still felt attached to the days when I was working on small little projects, MVPs, and just general websites for friends. I decided to take a year off and try my luck at startups. Before doing this, I had an idea to create, what essentially can be described as "Google maps for products". It was a way for people to quickly find the products they would want and determine which products are cheapest at what location and how to reduce travel time; and implicily gas. I managed to create an MVP and get good feedback from some people who I looked up to in the valley. However, it was a big undertaking and convincing retailers of giving up their data just to highlight more competition did not make sense. I decided to give up on this idea because it seemed very unrealistic with my limited set of programming and business skills. I did however, start researching startups in the field and stumbled upon Unata. I managed to get an interview, and performed very poorly due to nervousness (and of course, lack of programming knowledge). However, I was given the oppertunity to work there anyways. I spent a year there, and as I am writing this, I can say it was probably the best decision I have ever made. 

This essay is getting very long, my fingers are hurting and it's almost time for bed.
